# MicrophoneVolume
Current aim : When MicrophoneVolume.java is run, click resulting button on JFrame. Any input from the host's microphone will be written to "InputAudio.wav".
- From there, InputAudio.wav is analyzed and the program returns an overall decibel level.
Next Steps : Currently, audio is prone to peaking. Consider adjusting the settings of the AudioInputStream to avoid peaking.
- Consider adjusting how decibel level is calculated for increased accuracy.
- Consider updating host system's output volume to the result of this program.
